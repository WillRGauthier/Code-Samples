## About Me
I am an experienced game play engineer with a passion for engines and tools which enables me to collaborate with other developers to create powerful player experiences. I love learning and all things computer science, and I seek to understand at the most core level possible how things work.

## Repo Overview
This repository contains code samples from professional projects, personal and volunteer side projects, and school work, divided into the categories: [Unity](Unity), [Unreal](Unreal), and [Misc](Misc) based on whether and which game engine the work was conducted in.
